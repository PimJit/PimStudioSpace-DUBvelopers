    <p class="lead mt-3">I am a junior at the University of Washington studying Human Centered Design and Engineering. I grew up in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and was constantly exposed to multi-cultural perspectives on everything. I began my school going into biomedical engineering and here I am as an HCDE student! It took time and effort to finally see where my passion lies but it was well worth it.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>This started off as just a little hobby that I do on the side whenever I finish my crazy university homework. It was how I whine down after a busy day at school. I have always loved animals and now that I have two cats and a dog of my own, I feel like my love for animals just exploded to a whole other level. I love to just hangout in the same room and watch their personality shine as they play with each other </p>
    <br>
    <p>Walter, the tuxedo grey cat, is the naughtinest but most adorable one in our home. He is always the one who gets into, knock over, and destroy things around the house. When we come back home and something is brokem.. we know it's Walter.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Wilson is the queen of the house. Eventhough he is a male, the way he walks so beautifully and the sassiness that he has definiately gives him the Queen title. While Wilson will destroy anything on his path for a piece of bread, he constantly starts the fight and acts like he was the victim. ALL THE TIME.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And lastly we have Winston! The youngest and goofiest one. Thanks to his golden retriever genes, he becomes a goofball whenever he can and will beg for all your attention all day long. He is typically the victim of the Cat Gang attack... </p>
